DESCRIPTION : In today's world ability to collect data, decode and visually communicate data insights in real time matters the most rather than raw data.the main goal of this task is to focus on raw/real time data from public API's into clean insightul visulizations using python. In this task, we will step into the world of real-time data handling and visual storytelling, we are able to understand how to connect systems,handle responses and manage errors is just an important as writing a code itself. This task not only built your technical skill in API handling but also hones your ability to present  data-driven insights through impactful visual dashboards which is an essential skill in today's data-driven industries. Deliverables for this task include a well-documented python script and set of meaningful graphs or a visualization dashboard.

  This task involves some steps which are as follows:                                                                                                                                                                       
  1.The task begins with exploring publicly available APIs,here i have used OpenWeatherMap. This API offers a wide range of real-time data for weather forcast.     
  2.Using python, write a scrip to send HTTP requests to the API ,retrieve responses in JSON format,and parse the relevant data fields. Handling errors like 503(service unavailable) or 401(unauthorized).
  3.Once the data is collected our next step is visualization a crucial part of the project. i have used python library MATPLOTLIB to present the data in a meaningful and engaging way this includes line charts, bar graphs,scatter plots.  
    The goal is to help users understand trends,patterns and anomalies at a glance(turning data into a visual story).  
    
  Tools and libraries used in this task : requests, matplotlib, seaborn.

  This task not only tests technical proficiency but also creativity and attention to detail.A successful submission will demonstrate clean code practices,a solid grasp of data structures and an understanding of the user's perspective 
  when presenting visual data. In conclusion, this task is not just an assignment; it's a complete cycle of modern development from collection to presentation. It encourages interns to think beyond the code and focus on how technology 
  can turn information into impactful insights.
